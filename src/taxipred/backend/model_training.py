# Goal of this module (step 2):
# - Load CSV (via TAXI_CSV_PATH), apply the same cleaning functions. 
# - Keep only rows that have labels for supervised learning
# - Split into X (features) and y (target), ready for ML
# - Add: train/test split, infer numeric/categorical features, build shared preprocessor.

# Reuse shared, consistent data prep (train == inference):
# reuse the same cleaning/transformation rules everywhere (training and later in the API), avoiding train/serve skew.
